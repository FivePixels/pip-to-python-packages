# pip-to-python-packages
Helper script to move existing pip packages installed to Python packages from the AUR or the offical Arch Linux repositories.

## Usage
`./pip-to-python-packages.sh`

pip-to-python-packages **does not** remove the pip packages being migrated. You will need to remove them to prevent any overlapping packages.
